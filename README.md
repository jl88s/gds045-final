---------------

My idea was to re-create a website for my cousin's Printing business. Being that they didn't have proper shop images. I went ahead and found free images and logos so that I can then build up upon those styles and colors. It was difficult to focus on how I wanted to layout the site, but after gaining ideas from different shops online, I thought of creating something simple, but pops in colors. One major take-away from this final project: It made coding a lot of a pain seeing that I had already have a mock-up wireframe from Figma. With this, all I had to do was reference back-and-forth to my wireframe so I didn't have to get stuck coding things in the file and, then removing them when they don't work. Figma or wireframing in general seems crucial on building sites. 

What I could potentially work on is learning how to visualize the sizes placed on the wireframe so that when I do start coding, it will look identical to what I had invisioned.
